# Project sport hobbies

Welcome to my GitHub project aimed at analyzing the determinants of sport hobbies among young kids in France. As we all know, sports play a crucial role in the physical and mental development of young individuals, and it's essential to understand what factors influence their participation in sports. 

Through this project, I have utilized Python programming language to conduct exploratory data analysis and inferential statistical analysis on the data collected from various sources, including surveys and government databases. 

The objective of this project is to identify the key determinants that influence young kids' engagement in sports and provide insights that can help policymakers and sports organizations to design effective strategies to promote sports among youth in France. So, let's dive into the world of sports and explore what factors motivate young kids to engage in sports activities.
